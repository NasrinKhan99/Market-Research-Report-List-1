<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Atrial Fibrillation Surgery Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Catheter Ablation</li><li>Maze Surgery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Atrial Fibrillation Surgery Devices market primarily includes two main types: catheter ablation and maze surgery. Catheter ablation involves using a catheter to deliver energy directly to the heart tissue, eliminating irregular electrical signals causing atrial fibrillation. In contrast, maze surgery is a more invasive procedure that creates scar tissue in a specific pattern to disrupt faulty electrical pathways. Both approaches aim to restore normal heart rhythm, improving patient outcomes and quality of life in those suffering from atrial fibrillation.</p></p>
