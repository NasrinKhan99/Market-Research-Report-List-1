<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intrauterine Contraceptive Devices (IUCD) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-hormonal</li><li>Hormonal</li><li>Inert</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Intrauterine Contraceptive Devices (IUCDs) are essential contraceptive options, classified into three main types: non-hormonal, hormonal, and inert. Non-hormonal IUCDs, like copper devices, prevent sperm from fertilizing an egg. Hormonal IUCDs release progestin, thickening cervical mucus and thinning the uterine lining to prevent pregnancy. Inert IUCDs have no active ingredients and primarily rely on their physical presence in the uterus to disrupt sperm movement and egg implantation, making them effective long-term contraceptive solutions.</p></p>
