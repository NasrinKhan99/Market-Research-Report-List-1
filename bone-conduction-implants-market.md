<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bone Conduction Implants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Screw Implanted Device</li><li>Percutaneous Device</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bone conduction implants are categorized into two primary types: screw implanted devices and percutaneous devices. Screw implanted devices involve the surgical insertion of a titanium screw into the skull, providing a stable base for the sound processor, optimizing sound transmission directly through bone. In contrast, percutaneous devices utilize a mounted post that protrudes through the skin, allowing for easier attachment and removal of the sound processor. Both types enhance auditory perception for individuals with conductive hearing loss or single-sided deafness.</p></p>
