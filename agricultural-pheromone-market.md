<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agricultural Pheromone Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sex Pheromones</li><li>Aggregation Pheromones</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The agricultural pheromone market primarily consists of two types: sex pheromones and aggregation pheromones. Sex pheromones are used to attract specific insects for mating disruption, effectively reducing pest populations without harmful chemicals. Aggregation pheromones, on the other hand, attract insects to specific locations, aiding in monitoring and trapping pest species. Both types play crucial roles in sustainable pest management, enhancing crop yields while minimizing environmental impact, thereby supporting eco-friendly agricultural practices.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Agricultural Pheromone Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Detection & Monitoring</li><li>Mass Trapping</li><li>Mating Disruption</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The agricultural pheromone market focuses on three key applications: detection and monitoring, mass trapping, and mating disruption. Detection and monitoring utilize pheromones to identify pest populations and inform management strategies. Mass trapping employs pheromone-laden traps to capture significant numbers of pests, reducing their population. Mating disruption involves distributing synthetic pheromones to confuse and hinder communication between pests, preventing mating and ultimately decreasing pest numbers. Together, these strategies promote sustainable pest management and reduce reliance on chemical pesticides.</p></p>
